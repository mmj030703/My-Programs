Description :
You are given a string 'STR'. You have to convert the first alphabet of each word in a string to UPPER CASE.
For example:
If the given string 'STR' = ”I am a student of the third year” so you have to transform this string to ”I Am A Student Of The Third Year"
Note:
'STR' will contains only space and alphabets both uppercase and lowercase. The words will be separated by space.

Sample Input 1 :
3
I love programming
they are playing cricket
good to see you

Sample Output 1 :
I Love Programming
They Are Playing Cricket
Good To See You

Explanation Of The Sample Input 1:
For the first test case:
Given string is “I love programming” we will convert every letter after space to uppercase to give the output as ”I Love Programming”.

For the second test case:
Given string is “they are playing cricket” we will convert every letter after space to uppercase to give the output as  “They Are Playing Cricket”. 

For the third test case:
Given string is “good to see you” we will convert every letter after space to uppercase to give the output as “Good To See You”. 


Sample Input 2 :
3
why you are confused
Its a good day to be here
go and do your work

Sample Output 2 :
 Why You Are Confused
 Its A Good Day to Be Here
 Go And Do Your Work


Constraints:
1 <= 'T' <= 10
1 <= |STR| <= 10^5

Where |STR| denotes the length of the string.
Time Limit: 1 sec
